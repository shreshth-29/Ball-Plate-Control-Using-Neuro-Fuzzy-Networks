# Ball-Plate-Control-Using-Neuro-Fuzzy-Networks

## EEN-351 (Artificial Neural Networks) Course Project: Controlling a Ball Plate System using Neuro-Fuzzy Logic

The system consists of a Plate whose movements (Rotations) are controlled by 2 servo motors. We have to control the movements in a way which enables the ball to track any desired trajectory on the surface of the plate.

We first use a simple fuzzy logic based controller on the system and then try to convert it into a Neural Network Based (Neuro-Fuzzy) controller, and then compare the performance with other traditional (PID, LQR based) controllers. Our final controller consists of a Neuro-Fuzzy controller combined with a PID controller to eliminate  the steady state error.
